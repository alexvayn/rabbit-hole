# rabbit-hole

## Project Description
* Rabbit Hole is a base Jekyll project that uses the material theme and can be used as a semi-custimized starting point for building a static site.
* Published as GitHub Pages here: https://alexvayn.github.io/rabbit-hole/

## Why is it called Rabbit Hole?
* Because I spent way too much time going down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out why GitHub Pages weren't rendering correctly. I tried all sorts of crazy stuff, including generating all the content in a separte `gh-pages` branch. Finally, I came back full circle to this basic setup of letting GitHub generate the pages automaticall.
